# PulseLink
**Currently extracting data from the Apple Health app as I am working on connecting the hardware and software components.**

Repository for PulseLink, a real-time heart rate monitoring system that uses an Arduino and a PPG sensor to detect a userâ€™s pulse and stream the data to Firebase. The system enables live heart rate feedback, making it ideal for wellness tracking, stress monitoring, or remote health applications.
